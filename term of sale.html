    <p>MEDFORD's electronic commerce websites constitute offers for the sale of products and the provision of services for your applicable MEDFORD product (the "Offer"). An order or request that is properly entered through the applicable website, or any other form of acceptance that we receive from you, shall result in a contract for the purchase of the requested products or services on the applicable terms and conditions. MEDFORD's "Terms and Conditions of Sale" govern your product orders. At MEDFORD Service Online, the "Service Terms and Conditions" govern your requests for service and our standard list rates shall apply, unless other contractual rates are applicable to you.

    <p>You shall be deemed to have accepted all of the applicable terms and conditions except those to which you have specifically objected. You are required to set forth each objection to the applicable terms and conditions in writing, signed and dated by you and delivered to us prior to or contemporaneous with your order or request. Our failure to object to provisions in any communication shall not be a waiver of any of the applicable terms and conditions, nor an acceptance by us of any such provisions. Any terms proposed by you which are different from or additional to the applicable terms and conditions on our websites are hereby rejected unless specifically accepted by us in a separate document signed by both you and us, regardless of whether such other terms would materially alter the terms hereof. No course of dealing, custom or usage which is contrary to the applicable terms and conditions shall apply.</p>

            <h2>11. Warranty and Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A. Seller warrants that its consumable products comply with Seller's specifications. This warranty shall run for a period of 100 days from the date of shipment, unless the product is subject to an expiration date, in which case, the expiration date shall apply. Seller's warranties do not apply to damage resulting from unauthorized installation, accident, casualty, alteration, misuse, or failure to follow seller's written instructions. ENTIRE WARRANTY: SELLER MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. SELLER SHALL HAVE NO OTHER LIABILITY, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</li>
                <li>B. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of the foregoing warranties shall be the repair or replacement of the defective Product, or, at the Seller's option, a refund of the purchase price; provided (1) the Product has not been altered or modified by other than Seller, (2) it has been properly stored, installed, maintained and operated within the limits specified by Seller, and (3) Customer promptly sends to Seller notice of defect and satisfactory proof thereof, including allowing Seller the opportunity to inspect the Products, and in the event of repair or replacement, returns the product to Seller, freight prepaid. Defective parts replaced by Seller shall become the property of the Seller. Repaired or replacement parts will be shipped to the Customer FOB point of shipment.</li>
                <li>C. If the Product sold is not manufactured by Seller, Seller will extend to the Customer the same warranty protection Seller received from the original manufacturer.</li>
                <li>D. Seller is not responsible for any charges relating to warranty work or product replacement that have not been authorized by Seller in writing.</li>
                <li>E.  NEITHER SELLER NOR CUSTOMER SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR FOR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT, MATERIAL OR OTHERWISE, OR FROM ANY TORTIOUS ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF SELLER EXCEED THE PRICE OF THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OR OF THE PRODUCT SUBJECT TO LATE DELIVERY. If Seller, without separate compensation therefor, furnishes the Customer with advice or other assistance concerning any product supplied hereunder or any system or equipment in which any such product may be installed which is not required hereunder, the furnishing of such advice or assistance will not subject Seller to any liability whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>A. Seller warrants that Products shall be delivered free of any rightful claim for infringement of any Indian patent, trademark or copyright.</li>
                <li>B. If Seller is notified promptly in writing of any claim of infringement, Seller will defend or may settle at its expense any such claim. Seller shall pay all damages and costs awarded against Customer due to breach of this warranty; provided, however, that Customer must cooperate with Seller in the defense of any claim. Seller shall, at its expense and option, either procure for the Customer the right to continue using any infringing Products, or replace or modify them so they become non-infringing, or remove the Products and refund the purchase price (less reasonable depreciation for any period of use). The foregoing states the entire liability of Seller for patent, trademark, or copyright infringement by Products or any part thereof.</li>
                <li>C. The preceding representations shall not apply to any Product specified by Customer or manufactured to Customer's design, or to the use of any Product furnished hereunder in conjunction with any other item in a combination not furnished by Seller as a part of this transaction. As to any such item, part, or use in such combination, Seller shall have no liability whatsoever for patent, trademark or copyright infringement and Customer will indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless against any claims, liability, damages or expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, as a result of infringement claims arising therefrom.</li>
        </ul>
            <h2>13. Disclosure Information</h2>
            <p>Any information, suggestions or ideas given by the Customer to Seller in connection with Seller's performance hereunder are not secret or submitted in confidence, except as may be otherwise provided in writing, signed by Seller.</p>
            <h2>14. Assignments</h2>
            <p>No right accruing to the Customer by virtue of the manufacturer/purchaser relationship between Seller and the Customer nor any duty of Seller resulting from that relationship shall be assignable without Seller's prior written consent.</p>
            <h2>15. Governing Law: Remedies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A.  The rights and obligations of the Customer and Seller, and the construction and effect of any contract formed between them shall be governed by the laws of the State of Tamil Nadu.</li>
                <li>B.
